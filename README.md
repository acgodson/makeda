# Makeda

<!-- ðŸ‘‰ [Video Demo]() -->

## Description

### The Makeda platform facilitates peer-2-peer trading of ERC20 tokens using a priority-based matching system for automated trade execution (ATE).

<br/>
Users to submit trade orders, which are then matched with existing orders based on their priority level. The contract supports both partial and complete trades, enabling users to specify the desired quantity of tokens for each trade.

## Features

- Peer-to-peer approval
- Order size Priority  matching
- Time Priority matching
- Price Priority matching


## Requirements

HardHat and Nodejs Installed

```bash

git clone "https://github,com/acgodson/makeda"
cd Smart-Contract
npm install
```

Test Contract

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

## Smart Contract

The Solidity smart contract allows users to `submit trade order`s, `perform swaps`, and `cancel swaps`. It also includes some helper functions for the `ATE matching` and `exchange rate calculation`.

The `TradeHelper` contract provides helper functions for trade matching and exchange rate calculation. The` SwapERC2`0 contract provides functions for initiating and completing swaps.

Summary of the main functions:

- **submitTradeOrder**: Allows a user to submit a trade order. It transfers the trader's tokens to the escrow contract, calculates the counterparty amount based on the exchange rate, creates a new trade, and finds the best match for the trade. It then performs the trade matching and updates the trade states and balances.

- **getPendingSwaps**: Returns an array of pending swaps for a given user.

- **completeSwap**: Allows the counterparty of a swap to complete the swap. It marks the swap as completed, updates the trade states, and records the fulfillments.

- **cancelSwap**: Allows the initiator or counterparty of a swap to cancel the swap. It transfers the tokens back to the respective parties, updates the trade balances, and deletes the swap.

- **updateExchangeRate**: Allows the owner of the contract to update the exchange rate between two tokens.

In Summary, the Makeda Trade Contract provides a basic framework for submitting P2P trade orders and performing swaps between tokens, and can be modified to fit different use cases such _DEX, aunction platorms etc_
